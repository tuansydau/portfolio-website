                üòÄ I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer in Toronto. I grew up
                in Guelph, and moved to Toronto for school when I was 18.

              <div>
                üìñ I&apos;ve been programming since I was 12 years old - I
                started by programming Roblox games and making websites with my
                friends! I did Software Engineering at York University and loved
                it.

                üî® I focus on full-stack web development nowadays, but I have
                always loved working on all parts of the development process -
                especially UI/UX design.

                ‚úçÔ∏è Previously, I&apos;ve interned at Tesla, CertiK, Artemis
                Data, and a few other startups. I&apos;ve mainly done web and
                tools development, and I have found it to be really satisfying.
                I also love digging into other fields of programming in my free
                time (like shaders!).

                  listening to music with a cup of tea in hand üçµ, playing
                  Runescape, watching an F1 race üèéÔ∏è, or at a venue doing concert
                  photography! See my work @{' '}
