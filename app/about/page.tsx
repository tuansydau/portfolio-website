                üòÄ I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer in Toronto. I grew up
                in Guelph, and moved to Toronto for school when I was 18.

              <div>
                üìñ I&apos;ve been programming since I was 12 years old, starting
                by programming Roblox games and making websites with my friends!
                I continued programming in university, and completed Software
                Engineering at York University

                üî® I focus on full-stack web development nowadays, but I always
                love being involved in all parts of the development process -
                especially UI/UX design.

                üå¥ Previously, I&apos;ve interned at Tesla, CertiK, Skinopathy,
                Artemis Data, Big Whale Labs, and 4Pay Inc. I&apos;ve done
                everything from web development to data engineering to DevOps,
                so I&apos;d like to think that I&apos;ve become a well-rounded
                dev!

                  Runescape, watching an F1 race üèéÔ∏è, or at a venue doing concert
                  photography! See my work @{' '}
