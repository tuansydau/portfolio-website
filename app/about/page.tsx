                        <div>ðŸ˜Š I'm a software engineer from Toronto, Ontario. I originally grew up in Guelph (go gryphons!) and moved to Toronto for University.</div>
                        <div>ðŸ’¡ I originally learned to program to make Roblox games - I was 12, it was in Lua, and I was confused the entire time, but it eventually became fun and game development became a hobby of mine. I ended up switching to web development in university, but I still love playing games.</div>
                        <div>ðŸŒ´ Previously, I've interned at Tesla, CertiK, Skinopathy, Artemis Data, Big Whale Labs, and 4Pay Inc. I mainly do full stack development, UI/UX design, and DevOps, though :)</div>
                        <div>Outside of development, I really like:</div>
                        <div>Runescape </div>
                        <div>Concert Photography! I'd also love to shoot esports one day, check out my work: <a href='http://www.tuandau.ca' className="text-blue-300 underline">www.tuandau.ca</a></div>
